`delfi.distribution` and `delfi.neuralnet` build on code written by George Papamakarios, the original versions of which can be found at:

- https://github.com/gpapamak/epsilon_free_inference
- https://github.com/gpapamak/snl

The separation of classes in `delfi` is partially inspired by the design of [ELFI: Engine for Likelihood-Free Inference](https://github.com/elfi-dev/elfi).
